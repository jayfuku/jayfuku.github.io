## Overview

HSREndgameDB is a website designed to allow users to share clears of endgame content in the game "Honkai: Star Rail". Instead of trying to parse through Youtube searches or Reddit, you can now look through HSREndgameDB to find exactly what you want.

HSREndgameDB also preserves data of uploaded clears even after they're gone in the game to act as a sort of archive to get an idea of how the game evolves over time.

## Deep Dive

HSREndgameDB.info was created out of a problem I've noticed throughout my time playing live-service and live-service-esque videogames. New challenges would be added to the game on a regular basis but trying to find any information about strategies and gameplay was exremely tedious. The process often involved sifting through Google and Youtube search results which was filled with content unrelated to what I was looking for.

"Honkai: Star Rail" is the most recent game I've noticed that had this problem with new challenge stages being added biweekly and continually not being able to find videos or guides I can adapt to my account. From this struggle, HSREndgameDB.info was created to be a singular place for videos and guides to enhance knowledge sharing among players.

HSREndgameDB.info features the ability to upload, filter, and view posts about the latest and older challenge content from "Honkai: Star Rail".

HSREndgameDB.info is built on a Typescript+React Frontend which communicates with a PostgreSQL backend for the storage and retrieval of user-generated content. The website places a heavy emphasis on usability across mobile and desktop browser contexts because "Honkai: Star Rail" is widely played on both platforms.
